# Data_Structures-QueueAndStack
Queue and stack data structures implemented using a singly linked list.

The Queue and Stack classes utilize the singly linked list (LinkedList) class for their respective implementations.
The queue and stack classes implement basic methods such as add, remove, is_empty, push and pop. Queue and Stack both contain an instance of the LinkedList class and they use that instance to implement their logic.

Note that these are template classes and, as such, these data structures can be used to contain any data type.

The main.cpp file contains some informal unit tests that I did to make sure everything worked as expected.
